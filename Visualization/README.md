The visualizations include:

1. `AllPeaks_Provided_to_the_model_Sound_Age.png`: Displays all detected peaks in the sound data provided to the model, categorized by age.
2. `AllPeaks_Training_&_Test.png`: Shows a comparison of detected peaks in the training and test datasets.
3. `Envelope_and_spectrum_SamePlot_vib.png`: Combines the envelope and spectrum of vibration data in a single plot.
4. `MFCC_Coef_Vib_One.png`: Visualizes the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for a single vibration sample.
5. `NormalizedSpectrum_and_Normalized_EnergyBand_SamePlot_Vib_Age.png`: Plots the normalized spectrum and normalized energy bands of vibration data, categorized by age.
6. `Peaks_detected_sound.png`: Highlights the detected peaks in the sound data.
7. `Peaks_detected_vibration.png`: Highlights the detected peaks in the vibration data.
8. `SpectrumVsEnergyPerBand_Sound_Racket_Type.png`: Compares the spectrum and energy per band of sound data, categorized by racket type.

Each visualization is saved as a PNG file in the `Visualization` directory.
